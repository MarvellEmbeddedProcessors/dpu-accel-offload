Compiling Linux kernel from sources
***********************************

Here are the general steps to compile a Linux kernel:

Get the Linux Kernel sources
============================

Linux kernel sources can be downloaded from

.. code-block:: console

 git clone https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/linux-marvell.git
 cd linux-marvell
 git checkout linux-6.1.x-release

Setting up the environment
==========================

To set up the workspace for either native or cross compilation of the kernel,
the installation of the following packages is required:

.. code-block:: console

 sudo apt-get -y install build-essential imagemagick graphviz dvipng python3-venv fonts-noto-cjk latexmk librsvg2-bin texlive-xetex flex bison libssl-dev bc

Configuring and Building Kernel
===============================

Cross Compilation
-----------------

Cross-compiling a Linux kernel involves building the kernel on one platform
(the host) for use on another platform (the target). Here are the general

Getting the toolchain
`````````````````````

The cross-compiler toolchain is specific to the target platform. For example,
to cross-compile a kernel for AArch64 on Ubuntu ``gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`` is
required.

.. code-block:: console

 sudo apt-get install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu

Set environment variables
`````````````````````````

Export ``ARCH`` and ``CROSS_COMPILE`` environment variables.
ARCH specifies the target architecture, and CROSS_COMPILE specifies the prefix
for the cross-compile

.. code-block:: console

 export ARCH=arm64
 export CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-

Configuring the Kernel
```````````````````````

Use the following configuration obtained from the DAO repository to configure the kernel:

`Kernel Config <https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/dao/tree/dao-devel/config/kernel/v6.1/cn10k.config>`_

.. code-block:: console

 cp cn10k.config <path_to_kernel_directory>/arch/arm64/configs/
 cd <path_to_kernel_directory>
 make ARCH=arm64 cn10k.config

.. note:: If above steps reports "The base file '.config' does not exist.  Exit." error.
 As a workaround, ``touch .config`` in make kernel directory and retry the step.

This generates a .config file which can be edited if a driver needs any
changes in configuration such as enabling/disabling a driver, statically
built-in or loadable module of a driver into kernel.

Generating a kernel Image
`````````````````````````

.. code-block:: console

 make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- Image

With this, the Kernel Image is built and is located in ``arch/arm64/boot``

Generating and installing kernel modules
`````````````````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: console

 make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- modules

To install modules to a specific root file system, mount the rootfs first.
Then, use the ``INSTALL_MOD_PATH`` environment variable to specify the root
directory of the mount point.

.. code-block:: console

 make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=<Path_to_rootfs_mount_point>
 Eg.
    make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/mnt/disk

Native Compilation
------------------

Native compilation refers to where the kernel is built directly on the target
machine

Installing additional packages
``````````````````````````````

Apart from the packages mentioned above, install additional packages on target

.. code-block:: console

 sudo apt-get -y gcc make

Configuring the Kernel
```````````````````````

Same procedure as described in cross-compilation section

.. code-block:: console

 cp cn10k.config <path_to_kernel_directory>/arch/arm64/configs/
 cd <path_to_kernel_directory>
 make ARCH=arm64 cn10k.config

Building and install kernel modules
```````````````````````````````````

.. code-block:: console

 make ARCH=arm64 Image
 make ARCH=arm64 modules
 make modules_install

Kernel Image is built and located in ``arch/arm64/boot``, while modules are
installed to ``/lib/modules/`uname -r```

Kernel boot parameters
======================

Some important kernel boot parameters that need to be defined before booting the
kernel

 ``vfio-pci.enable_sriov=1`` to enable sriov support in userspace applications

 ``rvu_af.kpu_profile=ovs_kpu_cnxk`` load profile to configure flow classifier HW for
 extracting/parsingdifferent headers including tunnels. Required for OVS use cases only.

 ``vfio_platform.reset_required=0`` required only for virtio use case

.. code::

 Eg. booting rootfs from mmc card
  setenv bootargs "console=ttyAMA0,115200n8 earlycon=pl011,0x87e028000000 maxcpus=24 rootwait rw \
	  coherent_pool=16M root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 vfio-pci.enable_sriov=1 rvu_af.kpu_profile=ovs_kpu_cnxk"

 Eg. booting rootfs from nfs
  setenv bootargs "console=ttyAMA0,115200n8 earlycon=pl011,0x87e028000000 maxcpus=24 rootwait rw \
	  coherent_pool=16M root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=<path_to_rootfs_hosted_on_nfs_server> \
	  vfio-pci.enable_sriov=1 rvu_af.kpu_profile=ovs_kpu_cnxk  vfio_platform.reset_required=0"

Booting Kernel Image
====================

* Boot the target platform and stop at u-boot prompt.

* Setting up board environment and TFTP server:

.. code-block:: console

  # Set ethernet adaptor, some common adaptors are ax88179_eth or r8152_eth or e1000#0 or rvu_pf#4
  # set ethact <ethernet adaptor>
  Eg.
  crb106-pcie> set ethact e1000#0

  # Obtain dynamic IP using dhcp for the board or assign static IP
  # setenv ipaddr <board IP>
  Eg
  crb106-pcie> dhcp
  or
  crb106-pcie> setenv ipaddr 10.28.35.116

  # Set TFTP server IP
  # setenv serverip <TFTP server IP>
  Eg.
  crb106-pcie> setenv serverip 10.28.35.121

  # Verify the tftp server is reachable from the board.
  # ping $serverip
  Eg.
  crb106-pcie> ping 10.28.35.121
  Waiting for RPM1 LMAC0 link status... 10G_R [10G]
  Using rvu_pf#1 device
  host 10.28.35.121 is alive

* Load kernel image to DDR from the tftp server

.. code-block:: console

  # tftpboot $loadaddr <Path to firmware image in TFTP server>

  Eg.
  crb106-pcie> tftpboot $loadaddr Image_dao
  Waiting for RPM1 LMAC0 link status... 10G_R [10G]
  Using rvu_pf#1 device
  TFTP from server 10.28.34.13; our IP address is 10.28.35.115
  Filename 'Image_dao'.
  Load address: 0x20080000
  Loading: ##################################################  40.6 MiB
           8.5 MiB/s
  done
  Bytes transferred = 42615296 (28a4200 hex)

* Booting the kernel

.. code-block:: console

  # booti $loadaddr - $fdtcontroladdr

  Eg.
  crb106-pcie>  booti $loadaddr - $fdtcontroladdr
  Moving Image from 0x20080000 to 0x20200000, end=22bf0000
  ## Flattened Device Tree blob at 9f3909b20
     Booting using the fdt blob at 0x9f3909b20
